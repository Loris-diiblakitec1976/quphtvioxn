I just stumbled out of the theater after 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Heart Eyes, and honestly, I'm both exhausted and a little annoyed — but also kinda enchanted. It's one of those flicks that leaves you wondering if the screenwriters were okay or just seriously needing a hug. I mean, what was that even?? They took us on this bizarre rollercoaster, and I'm not sure I even had the seatbelt on half the time.

It's like walking into a candy store you always thought was closed and then realizing it's filled with the strangest flavors. Your choc-chip ice cream suddenly tastes like jalapeño, but somehow you’re not spitting it out. The characters are just so... there. Maybe too there? Like Sam, the lead — does he realize his hair is a separate entity? The man is a walking windstorm, and I don't even know if I'm supposed to relate to him or just marvel at his existence. Who wears a leather jacket with shorts, anyway? I thought I was over it until I wasn't, and now maybe I need a leather jacket... just kidding.

> And don’t even get me started on the love angle. It felt like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 a mildly disgruntled cat decide if a ball of yarn was worth its time. They had chemistry, sure, but it was more like a science experiment gone slightly wrong yet somehow still had to be graded. Or am I the only one who noticed how they were allergic to normal conversation? Seriously, the way they tossed around deep life philosophies over coffee. Relax guys, it’s just caffeine, not a TED Talk.

There's this scene where they're in a field of too-perfect flowers, talking about destiny or something. I was half expecting an alien spaceship to land just for kicks. I get it, 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮𝘮𝘢𝘬𝘦𝘳𝘴, you want magic, but picking a serotonin field isn't always the answer. Yet despite my gripes, there's something staggeringly human about the chaos. It's messy, unpredictable, like trying to balance with a warm, wobbly jelly on a stick. And frankly, that's life, isn't it? Probably gonna 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   for those What-the-hell-were-you-thinking moments.

Random Python code is the new thing, right? I guess it goes like this:

```python
def heart_eyes_confusion(love, destiny):
    while love < destiny:
        love += 1
    return Artificial happy ending

print(heart_eyes_confusion(2, 10))
```

Heart Eyes — it's that odd summer fling you can't stop thinking about even though you swear it gave you indigestion. Who knew cinematic indigestion could be a thing? Go 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  , maybe feel animatedly perplexed like I am right now. I need to find out who convinced me that buying popcorn was a good idea — it's probably in my shoe.
